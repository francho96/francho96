<h2 align="center"> Hi! My name is Franco ðŸ¤  </h2>
<h3 align="center"> I am Front-end developer... </h3>
<h3 align="center"> ...Full-stack sometimes </h3> 

I was born and live in Santiago de Chile, and I actually studied at the university with the same name, where I met a lot of people who influenced me to become the person I am now. I started to have interaction with computers when I was a child, on an old computer with Windows 95, but I was happy every time that I navigated on the internet, wondering how this all worked. The first time that I coded was in Pascal, I wanted to make games, but with my inexperience, I chose the wrong language. In 2014, I had a rematch with that, with AS3 (Actionscript 3), when I made my first Flash game. I applied to university in 2019, where I learned data structures, algorithms, and coding languages. In 2021, with the current pandemy, I began to learn more on my own. I entered the world of web development because I wanted to learn much more about the developer career, and with the fundamentals of my university was easy; HTML, CSS, and Javascript was a piece of cake, so I started with frameworks like React, Springboot, Vue, ETC. My native language is Spanish, and my second language is English with a certification C1, which is the highest certification in the career which I studied for, Software Engineering. If one day I have the opportunity to meet my younger version, I only need to say to him, thanks for your interest in computers
