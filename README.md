<h2> Hi! My name is Franco,🤠 </h2>
<h3> an Front-end developer </h3>

I am a freelance front-end developer. I was born and live in Santiago de Chile, and I actually studied at the university with the same name, where I met a lot of people who influenced me to become the person I am now. I started to have interaction with computers when I was a child, on an old computer with Windows 95, but I was happy every time that I navigated on the internet, wondering how this all worked. The first time that I coded was in Pascal, I wanted to make games, but with my inexperience, I chose the wrong language. In 2014, I had a rematch with that, with AS3 (Actionscript 3), when I made my first Flash game. I applied to university in 2019, and I had a lot of questions about my future, but my horizon has always been attached to programming, which I enjoy. I learned data structures, algorithms, and languages at university, and in 2021, with the current pandemy, I began to learn more on my own. I entered the world of web development because I wanted to learn much more about the developer career, and with the fundamentals of my university was easy; HTML, CSS, and Javascript were a piece of cake, so I started with frameworks like React, which was my favorite to develop, and make Svelte apps for fun (to me, learning other frameworks and comparing one to another is fun, my next target is Phoenix Live View). My native language is Spanish, and my second language is English with a certification B2 (Inglés 4), which is the highest certification in the career which I studied for, Software Engineering. If one day I have the opportunity to meet my younger version, I only need to say to him, thanks for your interest in computers.
